        I love Canada because it holds a quiet kind of beauty, one that doesn't shout, but gently surrounds you. I love the sound of snow crunching under boots in winter. I love the lakes, the forests, the mountains that remind you how small you really are, and how lucky you are to be standing there at all.
      </p>
      <p className="text-nord4 font-mono leading-relaxed mt-4">
        I love that Canada tries. It isn't perfect. Its history is complicated, painful, and still unresolved in many ways. But I love that there's space for different voices, different cultures, different truths. I love that reconciliation is not just a word here, but something people are beginning to live, question, and challenge, even if we still have far to go.
      </p>
      <p className="text-nord4 font-mono leading-relaxed mt-4">
        I love that being Canadian means many things, not just one. That identity here isn't a fixed shape, constantly changing.
