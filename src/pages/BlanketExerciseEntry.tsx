        Participating in the KAIROS Blanket Exercise gave me a deeper understanding of the impact of colonization on Indigenous peoples in Canada. I thought it was an engaging way to truly realize the full extent of the harsh factors placed on indigenous people. Things that we consider as trivial like diseases, housing, proper living conditionsâ€¦ These were the main causes of death for the indigenous people.

        The activity was also able to give me a physical representation of land, and show how that seemingly huge amount of blankets disappeared over just a small amount of time, was truly a novel experience. The difference before and after was like day and night. I was able to easily move from blanket to blanket in the beginning, but I had to jump in the end.

        Having tons of blankets (and friends) disappear in such a short amount of time was an extremely effective method of communication. The stark contrast, and how the activity was able to use physical objects of representation to give me the real experience of it, was really eye opening and helped me gain a new perspective on Canadian history.
