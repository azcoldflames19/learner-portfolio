        Language has, and will always play an important role in shaping the way we connect to various cultures. In the video, the term "Aboriginal" was explained to be less commonly used today, because it can imply other harmful meanings and doesn't truly represent the diverse identities of Indigenous peoples.

        It was also clear that different terms are understood in different ways depending on the context.

The meaning of these words have drastically changed over time, and it is always important to stay up to date and understand when to use each term.
