        Truth and Bright Water is an entirely different style of novel that I have never read nor analysed before. It was a novel experience, reading a book that had no plot. It was just a collection of stories that simply existed, and Tecumseh simply traveled through them. It was a story that hinted at a message that was never truly revealed until the very end.

        The unique imagery of the river, that has existed from the very beginning of the book, exposes itself bit by bit; symbolizing the passing of time, the split between towns, and the constant reminder of the theme of identity. The narrator has put special attention to detail in creating a truly genuine story. From the perspective of Tecumseh, we get to know what he thinks of every character, including himself.

        And the story finds time to include important parts of Indigenous storytelling, like the Trickster character of Monroe, and the intricacies of the landscape. The novel used magic surrealism to create an almost detached feeling, like how many other Indigenous stories may appear to be, but King always pulls us back to reality with his meaningful lessons.

        The book was a truly eye opening experience that helped me step out of the comfort zone that is western literature, and embrace the entirely different world of Indigenous storytelling.
